        The Department of Computer Science was established in 1990 in response to the government's National Information
        Technology plan for 2000-2005, which aimed at increasing the progress of computer information technology within Cambodia
        and other developing countries in the region. In accordance with this plan, the department trains Cambodian students to
        be skilled IT professionals in order to share the benefits of IT in a global network.
